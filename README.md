Early work in progress

This will be a machine learning system which attempts to predict the long-run value of publicly traded companies.

This will not be a day-trading bot, it will not learn from market price history, and it will at most attempt to predict the price of a stock in several years' time, not tomorrow or next year.

Short term to do:

    - Search API Archives for error messages
    - Handle JSON with multiple entries from same year
    - Cleanup try/excepts
    - Refetch problem data
        - ABNB balance-sheet-statement
        - LRCX
    - Get all market capitalizations on consistent date
